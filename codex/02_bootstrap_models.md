You are Claude Code. Plan and execute safe, non-destructive bootstrap steps for ComfyUI models:

**Tasks:**

1. Create standard models directories (if missing) under `ComfyUI/models/*`.
2. Print a checklist of recommended folders & what goes there.
3. DO NOT download weights automatically; instead, emit a to-do list with legal sources to fetch from.
4. If custom nodes are installed, include any extra model dirs they need.

**Deliver:** a concise summary and a CSV-style todo of `<folder>,<description>,<example files>`.
